# BookStore

This is a test assessment project

## Development

Update your local database connection in `application.yaml` or create your own `application-local.yaml` file to override
settings for development.

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be
added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/book-store-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
# Swagger

* After running the application, the swagger documentation can be found in http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
